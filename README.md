# Maintenance Window Recurrence

You can define the frequency at which a maintenance window recurs using daily, weekly, or monthly schedules. Hereâ€™s how to format each schedule type:

## Daily Schedule
- **Format**: `recurEvery: [Frequency as integer]['Day(s)']`
- If no frequency is provided, it defaults to 1.
- **Examples**:
  - `recurEvery: Day` (recurs every day)
  - `recurEvery: 3Days` (recurs every 3 days)

## Weekly Schedule
- **Format**: `recurEvery: [Frequency as integer]['Week(s)'] [Optional: comma-separated list of weekdays (e.g., Monday-Sunday)]`
- **Examples**:
  - `recurEvery: 3Weeks` (recurs every 3 weeks)
  - `recurEvery: Week Saturday,Sunday` (recurs every week on Saturday and Sunday)

## Monthly Schedule
- **Two possible formats**:
  1. `recurEvery: [Frequency as integer]['Month(s)'] [Comma-separated list of month days]`
  2. `recurEvery: [Frequency as integer]['Month(s)'] [Week of Month (First, Second, Third, Fourth, Last)] [Weekday (e.g., Monday-Sunday)] [Optional Offset (Number of days)]`

- The offset value must be between -6 and 6, inclusive.

- **Examples**:
  - `recurEvery: Month` (recurs every month)
  - `recurEvery: 2Months` (recurs every 2 months)
  - `recurEvery: Month day23,day24` (recurs monthly on the 23rd and 24th)
  - `recurEvery: Month Last Sunday` (recurs on the last Sunday of every month)
  - `recurEvery: Month Fourth Monday` (recurs on the fourth Monday of every month)
  - `recurEvery: Month Last Sunday Offset-3` (recurs on the Sunday before the last Sunday of every month)
  - `recurEvery: Month Third Sunday Offset6` (recurs 6 days after the third Sunday of every month)
